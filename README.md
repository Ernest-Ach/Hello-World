<p>Impact of Urbanization on Air Quality Index in Major US Cities.</p>
<h2 id="Description">Description</h2>
<p>With the increasing trend of urbanization in atleast 3000 US cities, there is growing concern about its impact on the quality of life and environmental conditions. This project aims to investigate how urban development, specifically in terms of population growth and infrastructure development, has affected the Air Quality Index (AQI) in major US cities over the past decade. We will utilize public datasets from the City of Chicago and Kaggle to gather data on urban development and AQI.</p>
